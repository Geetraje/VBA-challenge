This project is an exercise in learning how to analyse data from a large dataset from an excel file with many sheets.
The data consisted of various stocks, their opening and closing dates, opening and closing values and the number of stocks.
Here are the tasks that were performed on the data set -(in newly opened columns)
  Isolating each stock based on the ticker symbol
  Finding the difference between opening and closing values and the percentage
  The total volume of the stock for each ticker type
  Adding another results section to include the tickers that had the greatest increase, the greatest decrease and the one with the highest total stock          volume.
